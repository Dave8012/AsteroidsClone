# AsteroidsClone
<b>This is a clone of the game Asteroids written in JavaScript to be used in a web browser.</b>  
I have made this program to become more familiar with JavaScript and its abilities.
The bulk of the game is written in JavaScript linked with the HTML file and CSS file.<br>
## How to Play 
-The game starts when the webpage has loaded    
-WASD or the Arrow Keys are used to move the spaceship around the screen

-If all the asteroids are destroyed, the game moves up a level  
-Each level adds two more starting asteroids to the game
